Hey! I'm Joe,  34 year old web dev. 

I’m a big gamer, love animals and really feel alive while being creative.

In 2013 I moved from England to Norway and started working in a large toy store, a career I held up until the end of 2021. I was often praised for my communication skills as well as my will to improve the workplace and was duly appointed assistant-manager. The position was rewarding, however I couldn’t help but feel a part of me was going unfulfilled, an undiscovered passion to pursue. 

While taking it upon myself to gain skills in video (premier pro) and image editing (photoshop) in order to boost my store's social media presence, I discovered what was going unfulfilled, a love for tech!. 

At this point I knew my passion had to be pursued and at the start of 2022 I began learning front-end and soon joined Kodehode, a full-stack course with 6-months of theory followed by a 6-month apprenticeship in order to develop my skills. 

With my wealth of real-world interpersonal experience and recent programming skills I'm very excited for what my future holds!
